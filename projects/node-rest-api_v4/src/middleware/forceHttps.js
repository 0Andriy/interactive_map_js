/**
 * Middleware to force all incoming HTTP requests to be redirected to HTTPS.
 * This is useful for ensuring secure communication for your web application.

 * If `true`, HTTP requests will be redirected to HTTPS.
 * If `false`, the middleware will simply pass the request to the next handler.
 * @returns {function(import('express').Request, import('express').Response, import('express').NextFunction): void} An Express middleware function.
